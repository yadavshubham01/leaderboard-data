      "text": "Hello Team!, I'd love to contribute to the Diet Management module in CARE for GSoC. My experience with ReactJS, NodeJS, TypeScript, and Django aligns well with the project requirements. I'm eager to work on meal plan integration, calorie tracking, and patient record sync while ensuring a seamless user experience. Looking forward to your guidance on getting started!\nIf requested i can share a quick proposal for the team to review and approve.\n\nAdditionally, we can also implement if required:\n- Meal reminders, sending notifications to users for their scheduled meals based on their diet plan.\n- Basic diet progress tracker, showing trends in calorie intake and nutritional balance over time.\n- AI-driven hydration reminders, which analyze meal intake and activity levels to suggest optimal water consumption throughout the \n   day.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
