When someone wants to take a quick look over what the contributor has been up to, the animation makes it feel slow. A delay of 0.05 would be ideal maybe?\n\n\n\nYes, it's possible. Using the useInView feature from framer-motion, we can implement that. However, since my exams are ongoing until March 14th, I am unable to work on this right now. 😔\n"

It boasts a weekly download count exceeding 100k+ across both modern and legacy browsers, making it a robust solution for our needs. Given the frequency with which we'll be implementing scrollbars across various components, using this package seems both practical and efficient.\r\n\r\nI'm prepared to integrate this package into our workflow if you believe it aligns with our objectives. Otherwise, I'm fully capable of proceeding with the conventional methods outlined in the documentation.🚀"
