However, our OG image background is white, making it difficult to see. For the OG image, a white background is more suitable. Additionally, the leaderboard is a tool that will be used by other organizations, so each organization may prefer their logo. Therefore, I thought it best to use the same logo as found on the internet.\r\n\r\nIf there any suggestion regarding styling or addition?"
