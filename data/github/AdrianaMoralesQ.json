I added three relevant strings to the en locale files in en/Common.json.\r\n- [ ] Added <CircularProgress/> inside the \"Add\" button. It replaces the \"Add\" instead of appearing beside it because IMO it looks better - otherwise the button grows and shrinks when the spinner appears/disappears. \r\n- [ ] CircularProgress was added instead of null\r\n"
