But it should be shown as 8:50AM. There is another attribute `modified_date` in the response of the endpoint `/api/v1/consultation/{consultation_external_id}/prescriptions/` which I think should actually  contain the last time the prescription is updated which is 8:50 AM as per above example but the `modified_date` contains the same value as `created_date`. I think this should also be fixed on the backend only.\r\n\r\nPreviously before the above fix on backend we used `last_administered_on` for this part."

After trying out a different approach I noticed that the 1st administration is not being displayed in the table when the 1st administration was sent into second page of paginated table.

So I started working and forgot to assign it to myself. Guess we started almost at the same time.\r\n\r\nI checked your latest PR, setting the limit to null removes it from the URL but that breaks the purpose of limit. There are 14 patients displayed per page instead of 12. Also the pagination component which is used to navigate to different set of patients is replaced by red colored text saying \"Do not render Pagination component, when limit is <= 0\"\r\n\r\nI changed my PR to a draft PR. So let me know if you can resolve this, I will close my PR."
