This loader will maintain layout consistency and improve user experience. Additionally, I’ll replace the current static empty state with a more informative and user-friendly empty state — including an icon, message, and optional CTA (e.g., \"Book your first appointment\").\n\nExpected Timeline:\nEnd date: April 7, 2025\n\nAdditional Context:\nNo new dependencies are needed. This enhancement is focused on improving the UI/UX and can be implemented using the current component structure. Will ensure it's mobile-responsive and accessible.\nplease assign me this work"
