There are some fields which are common on every header like export/import , filters , a search field, section name, counts\r\n2. Some CTA are present on some headers, these are different for different sections .\r\n3. Some pages contain some switches for parsing different data.\r\n4. Some pages contain more than one search fields.\r\n\r\nThe mockup solves all these problems, as:\r\n1. The fixed fields are kept constant at one corner .\r\n2. These CTA can be added according to our needs and are optional, can handle more buttons too in grid system\r\n3. We can fix a switch on the topmost side of header which is optional\r\n4. I have provided a dropdown in search field, where one can select the search prop to be search and add more such search fields.\r\n\r\nin technical aspect\r\nLets create a header component capable of all these features, it would have props which would control all these fractures like:\r\n\r\n<Header title=\"Facilities\" count=\"3000\" searchFields=[] ctaArray=[{name,onClickFunction}]/>\r\n\r\ncc: @nihal467 @Ashesh3 \r\n"
