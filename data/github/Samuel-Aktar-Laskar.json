For UI linked issue, I am using graphql (https://stackoverflow.com/a/61940472). Let me know if there is any better way to do. I tested the same by making demo issue and prs in my own account, and it seems to work fine. \r\n\r\nRest are the changes in sorting logic. \r\nLet me know the changes or improvements required. \r\n  "
