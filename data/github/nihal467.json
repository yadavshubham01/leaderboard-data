For now, we can use the static OTP : 45612\n\n- Login with the static OTP is also not possible\n\n### Minor Issue\n\n- [ ] add the translation to the username and password error message in the staff login\n- [ ] add the translation to the OTP sent successfully notification for the patient login section\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86cdcaff-71ad-40c8-a876-30ce64cc9812)\n\n- [ ] Add proper error message for incorrect OTP-based patient login on the homepage\n\n---\n\n## [Facility Public Page](https://care.do.ohc.network/facilities?state=1&facility_type=840&page=1&limit=14)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cceaf63f-7c41-4a27-b22d-228d0e1221e9)\n\n### Minor Issue\n\n- [ ] The Facility Type advanced filter on the Facility Public Page is not working because the facility type details are not shown on the card. We can either hide the filter or display the facility type details on the card and fix the related filter functionality. \n\n### Enhancement\n\n- [ ] Add a back button to the facility public page, which users can use to go back to the initial district selection [page](https://care.do.ohc.network/)\n- [ ] Add a login button of the right side top corner, so users can always go to the login page from the public page\n\n---\n\n## [Facility Details Page](https://care.do.ohc.network/facility/0aef5488-ea4d-4280-938a-d6b2fb44df59)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1de0bb78-9cd9-40f0-ae41-ed2b530e728a)\n\n### Minor Issue\n\n- [ ] Only show the doctor users in the facility detail public page for booking appointments, as they are the only users who will be requiring a appointment book (Product Discussion Required)\n\n### Enhancement\n\n- [ ] Add support to search the doctor's name / Qualification in the facility details page\n\n---\n\n## Booking Appointment\n\n### Major Issue\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd5e4e26-613e-4dcb-9509-78bb63f54cd3)\n\n- [ ] We can use an invalid OTP such as 00000 to login to the appointment portal and register a patient, even though the frontend throws a 400 error, so handle the situation with proper validation and gracefully\n\n### Minor Issue\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/020ff3a4-6fa9-4de8-b3a0-c00e55a9fd9c)\n\n- [ ] Add fine text for age mentioning to the user that, only the year of birth will be saved if they are using the age field\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d564f5d-6361-48c4-9595-19b0f604edcc)\n\n- [ ] Add support to the current address field allowing users to type address in multiple lines\n\n---\n\n## [User Details Page](https://care.do.ohc.network/users/nibras-doctor/availability)\n\n### Major Issue\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b34ef0cc-508c-4859-ac39-3a0098dfe80d)\n\n- [ ] When we try to create an availability schedule for a user, **without mentioning the weekly schedule**, submitting the form crashes the page. Additionally, each time we open the Availability section on the user's detail page of the same user, the page kept on crashing\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03737a76-dc76-4e56-b141-be84d76c1cc3)\n\n- [ ] When we try to create a schedule exception for a user, its throwing 404 error in the frontend\n\n### Minor Issue\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4c0189-5abd-4be4-98b6-8e1953064ba9)\n\n- [ ] Replace the return to care icon with Return to Linked Facilities\n- [ ] Repositon the icon and button of no home facility so, we can avoid unwanted scroller in this page\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/803a381d-550b-4eb3-bd36-09670e69f4d5)\n\n- [ ] When there is no exception available for a user, the loader is keep on loading infinitely\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f02df1a-dac5-4423-a4e0-13214ac2b216)\n\n- [ ] The weekly schedule field in the create schedule template form is not properly responsive\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d779635f-d7e5-4c8b-b295-3f0e36a69882)\n\n- [ ] the info card in the session section of create schedule template is not properly responsive\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81348104-31c2-489d-914a-b04c34e174a3)\n\n- [ ] the return to CARE button in the crashing page is not redirecting properly to the loginpage \n\n### Enhancement\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/188d19c0-c3ae-47ce-98ab-ab085fae4182)\n\n- [ ] Add an option to edit the existing schedule template of the user\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/babb2266-3cb6-4152-9eb0-3ed3981dd831)\n\n- [ ] Use color coding for the dates to clearly indicate their availability status—such as available, fully booked, nearly full, and unavailable—making it easier to understand availability at a glance without needing to click on each date."

Currently, patients can be created with a 9-digit number. Ensure proper error messages are displayed.\r\n- [ ] Add a mandatory validation for the age field in the patient registration form.\r\n- [ ] Unable to create a new patient / Edit a existing patient by mentioning patient age only\r\n- [ ] When a patient is created with a DOB, and we later visit the patient’s edit page, the DOB field is replaced by the calculated age based on the provided DOB. If we manually switch back to the DOB field, it appears blank.\r\n- [ ] the ration card details are not been stored while creating new patient or updating existing one\r\n- [ ] the occupation details are been stored but when we open the edit registration form page, the field is blank\r\n\r\n## Issue that can be taken in another PR\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add a translation for non-binary sex to transgender in patient registration form\r\n- [ ] Reset the patient search field when the related badge are been removed\r\n- [ ] Add a placeholders for all dropdown as per the figma file\r\n- [ ] The tab switching functionality does not properly use colors, making it difficult for users to identify the currently active tab on the initial load of the 'All Patients' page.\r\n- [ ] Restore Draft feature is missing in the new patient registration form\r\n\r\n## Question\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b58678f5-fdf3-42b7-a29d-766bddb24b51)\r\n\r\n- [ ] When filling out the patient registration form, the patient transfer form pops up for matching phone number. Can't we consider implementing this workflow in the patient search instead? Since we are already searching for all patients with the same number, couldn't the workflow be incorporated there?"

Additionally, intercepts are already included, so there is no possibility of using additional intercept here.\r\n> \r\n> In PatientRegistration.tsx, removing cy.wait(3000) at line 158 results in a test case failure, indicating that after selecting the gender as \"Female,\" the \"Is antenatal?\" checkbox is not displayed. No intercept is triggered when the gender selection is clicked.\r\n> \r\n> In patientFileUpload.ts, removing cy.wait(2000) at line 30 within the verifyUploadFilePresence function causes the \"User-level Based Permission for File Modification\" test case to fail, while other test cases pass. I attempted to include intercepts, but the issue persists at the same point.\r\n> \r\n> Could you please look into this?\r\n\r\nwill look into these, can you clear the requested changes"

Since you are accessing the page as  admin,  you can view the details. However, ideally, once a patient is discharged, the patient details page should not be accessible to staff members\n\nThis problem occurs because the patient details page is shared across CARE and is not specific to a particular facility.\n\nTo address this, we need to define the ideal behavior. Some potential solutions include:\n\n- Removing the \"live\" status badge from the patient details page.\n- Updating the \"live\" badge to display the name of the current live facility, providing more context.\n\nOr Exploring other approaches to better align the page behavior with the expected workflows after discussing with the users and product teams, meanwhile I am blocking this issue and assigning it to you"

Many users with district admin roles rely on this access to manage certain data.\r\n\r\nThe main issue we’re aiming to resolve is to ensure that non-admin users cannot access consultation files of a facility that isn’t linked to their user ID. If a non-admin user who is not linked to a facility tries to access facility data, either by clicking on a patient card to view consultations from the patient list page or by using the \"View Consultation\" button on the patient details page, an error message—such as \"You don't have access to this file\"—should be displayed instead of redirecting them to a 404 page.\r\n\r\nCould you review his deploy preview along with my comment, and then provide a response?"
