Go to a patient consultation dashboard\r\n2. Link an Abha number\r\n3. Go to another patient's consultation dashboard\r\n4. Link the same Abha number again\r\n\r\nThat will trigger the error you see in the comment mentioned. \r\n\r\nHave a conditional check if the Abha number already exists before creating the Abha number, and return a response with a neat error message."

We are exporting ExportMenu and ExportButton JSX components from the useExport hook, so as the useExport hook is called at every render, these also are changing _(function signatures)_ and rerendered. The jumping is because of the difference in time taken to render the icons used inside the 2 above-mentioned functions. \r\n\r\nI think converting the hook to a component should fix it, what are ur thoughts?"
