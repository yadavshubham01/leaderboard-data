(for eg. based on what city is selected)\r\n\r\nIf we rely on options.length in the selectMenu itself, we loose the 'choose an option' placeholder initially and tend to display the 'no option available'. This is not the right way. Either we should handle it at where we use the component\r\nor \r\nAnother approach to handle is to move away from showing it in placeholder and displaying an option when the selectmenu is clicked as 'no option available'(disabled thereby cannot select this as well)\r\n\r\n"

      "text": "> Wouldn't this be better if we moved this logic to the Select Menu component itself so it'd be applicable in all use cases?\r\n\r\nSince the logic of either disabling or the placeholder text 'No options available' relies on the length of the option, taking that into selectmenu component is not viable unless we bring in a new prop to configure that again. So,  'options.length' is a good to have in the component which is utilising the SelectFormField(SelectMenuV2) "

Also, handle the option length logic in the select component. so that Listbox.Options will not be rendered if empty array is passed for options. \r\nSolution 2: In the SelectMenuV2 component, do a check for the options array length and render the ListBox.Options with passed values when it is not empty and show 'No option found' disabled option in the ListBox when it is empty. \r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts on this."
