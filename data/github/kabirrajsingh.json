      "text": "@Sulochan-khadka it is actually a restriction on the basis of District, I raised the issue in the last standup. A district admin can only use the action buttons in his own district, which in this case is Thiruvananthapuram. When you try to use it on user from another district, it would throw an error. We can work on this together but the issue needs discussion first as to which approach would be the best to solve it."

      "text": "Hi @khavinshankar . Regarding fetching the medical records part and the booking a slot for OP consultation, \r\n1.do we also need to include the medical records from Care Backend (basically things included in https://care.coronasafe.in/facility/{facilityID}/patient/{patientId}/files or just the user records uploaded to ABDM (https://sandbox.abdm.gov.in/abdm-docs/UploadingUserRecord) ?\r\n2. For booking a slot for OP Consultation, should this be a seperate module (like booking consultations within the ABDM environment between the PHR and health facility) or should this also be connected to the care backend, like displaying the OPD consultations as well in the patients tab, since the current consultation module mostly focuses on the in patient daily rounds consultation. \r\n3. Given a consultation record needs to be made between the PHR and health facility, do we need to simply put it through the queue or do we also need to integrate it with the Generic Scheduling System (https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/issues/7424)"
