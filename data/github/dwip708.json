      "text": "Hey @rithviknishad ,\r\nI found a bug in the shifting section. I had done the scroll thing but the issue is that even if there are more than 14 patients in any section, only 14 are loaded by pagination. THERE IS NO MORE OPTION. It is expected to have a more option at the end, but there is some bug in the code so it is not showing, EVEN IN ORIGINAL HOSTED WEBSITE. I am working on that, I will sort it real soon.  I have shared a ss of the bug. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/assets/97839370/4692662b-5bae-40f6-846c-cece306bd434)\r\n"
