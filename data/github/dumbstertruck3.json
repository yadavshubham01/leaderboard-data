      "text": "Been on this for months now, When i started working all i knew was a bit of shell scripting i learned for a hackathon. i was about to give up then one of the maintainers called me and told me that this will be a great opportunity for me to learn new things and he was right, i learned a damn lot. Thing is i don't get much time for doing this things, but i will be working on this, got a couple of ideas to make the restoration easier. so yeah there will be more pr's :)"
