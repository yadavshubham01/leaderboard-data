If you agree, please do edit the issue description otherwise it could be confusing for reviewers and testing "

I suggest only displaying that statement if the username is available.\r\n - That message is only for username validation result  we can update the typo here like `Your Username is valid` that too specifically for validations checks only nothing related to availability of username \r\n \r\n - [ ] When each check passes the validation, do not make the statement disappear; instead, make the statement green and add a green tick adjacent to it.

Here's how to implement it:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Update the translation keys in `public/locale/en.json`:\r\n> \r\n> ```json\r\n> {\r\n>   \"entity_count_one\": \"{{count}} {{entity}}\",\r\n>   \"entity_count_other\": \"{{count}} {{entityPlural}}\"\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> 2. When using the translation, provide both singular and plural forms:\r\n> \r\n> ```ts\r\n> t(\"entity_count\", {\r\n>   count: facilities?.count || 0,\r\n>   entity: \"Facility\",\r\n>   entityPlural: \"Facilities\"\r\n> })\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> This approach will handle irregular plurals correctly (like \"person\"/\"people\") instead of just adding 's' to the singular form. Would you like me to help you implement this change across all the files?\r\n> \r\n> 🔗 Analysis chain\r\n> 🏁 Scripts executed\r\n\r\nHey Team, Do we really need to do that ? It just makes it too complex for simple translation"

We can set the relevant values for both doctors and nurses while keeping it undefined for other user types.
