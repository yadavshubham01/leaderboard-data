      "text": "\r\nHello @nihal467  and @rithviknishad ,\r\n\r\nI am Atinder Kumar, a dedicated undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science. My passion for software development is fueled by a desire to make meaningful contributions to real-world projects. My motivation for applying to this project stems from a strong interest in cybersecurity and a commitment to enhancing data protection measures.\r\n\r\nWith proficiency in ReactJS, TypeScript, Django, and Python, I am well-equipped to contribute to the implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).  \r\nSo I hope I could get a chance to work on this open-source project which aims to contribute towards the health sector through GSOC .\r\n\r\nWarm Regard\r\nAtinder Kumar\r\n"
