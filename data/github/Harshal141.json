My name is Harshal, and I'm currently a third-year student at AIT Pune, pursuing my BE degree. I'm excited to express my interest in contributing to this GSoC project.\n\nHaving previously worked on a similar project during my internship, I bring valuable experience in working with GitHub and Slack APIs. If you'd like to verify my background, I've also documented my journey in a blog post: https://medium.com/@harshalmukundapatil/summer-internship-at-fyle-8686994d862e\n\nI'm confident that my skills and dedication make me a strong candidate for this opportunity. I'm committed to delivering efficient and well-structured code, and I'm particularly aligned with the project's tech stack.\n\nLooking forward to potentially collaborating with you all!\nBest regards, \nHarshal"
