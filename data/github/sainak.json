It looses type safety which shouldn't be ideal for sensitive infos like tokens. Here's one more article suggesting it should only used in case of flexibility [totaltypescript.com/concepts/any-type](https://www.totaltypescript.com/concepts/any-type)\r\n\r\nType safety is only relevant for development, once the code is transpiled, there is no role of typescript in browsers, so how would replacing 'any' help?"
