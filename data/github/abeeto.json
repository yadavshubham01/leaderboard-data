      "text": "> [@AdityaJ2305](https://github.com/AdityaJ2305) I have tried to solve this issue but I am not exactly getting where is the issue. The way in which _DiagnosisQuestion_ component is written differs a bit from how _SymtomQuestion_ and _AllergyQuestion_ components are written. These all components share common logic for while the form is submitted in _QuestionnaireForm.tsx_ but the problem is only occuring in the case of Diagnosis Form. I have checked for the logic part but I didn't find any bug there like all things are proper. I tried to remove the `exclude_verification_status` key but I guess it is responsible only to decide whether to show the `entered_in_error` rows to the user. Also other status are getting reflected only the problem occurs with _remove_diagnosis_, the status is getting to `confirmed` as if it is some default value.\n> \n> I am not getting how to proceed from here. Can you help me out about exactly where I am going wrong.\n\nI managed to get it fixed in my draft PR,  setting `dirty` prop to `true` in the `handleRemoveDiagnosis` fn did the trick."

This state should be overridden/ignored when editing.\n\nAs for the bug @AdityaJ2305 mentioned, I'm not sure what the expected behaviour is.. \nOn submit, should the diagnosis table on Encounter page show the record with `entered-in-error` status? Because when I try to create a record with the `entered-in-status` or modify it, the encounter page either removes it from the diagnosis table."

TableCell got a `whitespace-wrap`  added which is why my code was no-longer working, as I have a useEffect that needs to check if text is wrapping in order to render the expand.\r\n\r\nAdded a quick fix by just overriding the class to  `whitespace-normal`  for this particular `TableCell` element.\r\nPlease have a look now, should work!"

Feel like they're both quite similar and in practice people would just one. \n\nFrom UX perspective, slot duration seems more useful because people won't have to do as much mental maths (can just say 30mins/session). But the logic for this would be more complex I think (how to divide sessions times as close to the slot duration provided)"
