    "title": "Should we move over to react-query?",
    "text": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/react-query\r\n\r\nReact Query is a powerful package for managing APIs with type safety, caching, infinite queries, and inbuilt state management.\r\nIt is almost the standard for managing APIs in react.\r\n\r\n## Why to move\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons are developer experience, and ease of maintenance. Lets take an example using the current request component in our codebase\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nconst [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)\r\nconst [errors, setErrors] = useState([])\r\nconst [data, setData] = useState();\r\n\r\nconst query = useQuery(\r\n   route,\r\n   ...\r\n)\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => setData(query.data), [query.data]);\r\n\r\nconst handleUpdate = async () => {\r\n  setLoading(true);\r\n  const req = await request(...., data);\r\n  if (req.ok) {\r\n    notify(\"Ok\")\r\n    query.refetch()\r\n  } else {\r\n    notify(\"Error\")\r\n    setErrors(req.data)\r\n  }\r\n  setLoading(false);\r\n}\r\n\r\n{loading && \"Form is submitting\"}\r\n{errors && \"Form has errors\"}\r\n\r\n... make a form for our data\r\n<button onClick={handleUpdate}>\r\nsave\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis includes states like loading and error that is very cumbersome to write and maintain.\r\nHere is the same thing with react-query\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nconst [data, setData] = useState();\r\nuseEffect(() => setData(query.data), [query.data]);\r\n\r\nconst query = useQuery({\r\n  queryKey: [\"myquery\", \"type\"],\r\n  queryFn: ...\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst mutation = useMutation({\r\n  mutationFn: () => ....,\r\n  onSuccess: () => query.refetch();\r\n})\r\n\r\n{mutation.isPending && \"Form is submitting\"}\r\n{mutation.errors && \"Form has errors\"}\r\n\r\n...form\r\n\r\n<button onClick={() => mutation.mutate(data)}>\r\nsave\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWay easier to maintain and check for statuses.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of such usecases that will reduce the complexity of our codebase significantly. The less state management the better.\r\n\r\n## Pros of migrating\r\n\r\n- better DX\r\n- easier for new contributors to understand the codebase as most have prior experience with reactquery\r\n- Typesafe\r\n- we wont have to maintain our own hooks\r\n- easier to make infinite queries\r\n- has inbuilt context, so you can interact with a query from a child component without passing down props.\r\n\r\n## cons\r\n\r\n- Too much refactoring\r\n- another dependency package.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, it makes sense for us to switch over, and gradually deprecate the old hooks.\r\n\r\ncc. @bodhish \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Assist new patients by providing hospital and doctor details, answering FAQs, and guiding them through registration.\r\n2.  Enable appointment booking via natural language processing (NLP), allowing users to request appointments based on symptoms, doctor availability, or specialty.\r\n3.  Work across multiple platforms, including web, mobile, and messaging services like WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nDescribe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n1. 1. A manual search and booking system without AI assistance (less efficient, requires user effort).\r\n2. A traditional appointment form-based system (does not provide conversational ease or symptom-based booking).\r\n\r\n",
