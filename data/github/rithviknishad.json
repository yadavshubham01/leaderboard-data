With `useAtom` you could simply use it like a `useState` and the state be synced with local storage by Jotai.\r\n\r\n"

However, the discharged patients page was built fairly recently when `PaginatedList` was available for use. Hence the `ManagePatients.tsx` was never migrated to use the `PaginatedList` component, simply because it was not a priority and worked fine without it too.\r\n\r\n`PaginatedList` component is useful when you want to list items from a query that returns a paginated response, this component will render the `Pagination` component along with the children and also handles the page state management internally. It simply reduces the amount of code required to get some of the common things such as these done."

I appreciate your enthusiasm for making the application more efficient and user-friendly. However, I noticed that the recommendation to use react-router-dom may not align with the specific framework we’re using, which is Next.js.\r\n\r\nNext.js has its own built-in routing system that handles navigation and routing efficiently without the need for react-router-dom. Given that, the package isn’t necessary for this project, and replacing Link href=\"...\" with Link to=\"...\" as suggested wouldn’t be applicable here.\r\n\r\nIt might be helpful to review the existing codebase to ensure suggestions are fully aligned with the technologies in use. This will ensure that all proposed improvements are relevant and beneficial for the project’s specific context.\r\n"

It's purely a front-end and thing and has nothing to do with backend. Let's drop ID, it's also not being referenced anywhere else. Also you can drop the type `Array<OptionsType>` for CONSULTATION_TABS and simply do `as const` which should take care of the type safety."

I.e., If a patient is readmitted to a different facility, users of the latest facility can \"view\" all the consultations regardless of which facility the previous consultations belong to.\r\n\r\n**New**:\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n- [ ] Allow users who have access to view the patient details to also be able to view all previous consultations regardless of which facility the previous consultations belonged to.\r\n- [ ] Allow users to view all consultation history (regardless of facility) if the active/latest consultation belongs to the facility that the user belongs to. However, if the user belongs to a facility which is not the latest consultation facility, they won't have permission to view consultations that took part in other facilities of the patient. (This could lead to confusion to the user as they'll loose access to the full consultation history once the patient is readmitted to a different facility)."

So we have `RoleButton` component that serves the purpose.\r\n\r\nHowever, its a legacy component since it was built in early days to work along with material ui and all. Nowadays we have `ButtonV2` tailwind based component which is widely used. This custom component also supports disabling based on user type, which can be specified with the `authorizedFor` prop.\r\n\r\nThis way we won't need to use seperate components to restrict access, just use the same ButtonV2 component and add authorizedFor=___.\r\n\r\nThis helps in keeping designs consistent and maintaining the codebase in long run."

Each file specified in the task contains one or more serializers that inherit `ModelSerializer`, which has to be split to separate `<ModelName>ListSerializer` and `<ModelName>DetailSerializer` so as to minimize joins. Each of these specific serializers should serialize information that is required by/used in the front end.\r\n\r\nYou may have a look at our front end and understand which all fields are required, and keep only those information in the List Serializer. DetailSerializer can inherit the list serializer and include all other information.\r\n\r\n"

Which is a `Record<key, value>` where value is a string or a ref. ID as string, right?\r\n\r\nThe parent component (eg. `AssetsList`) is getting the query params `useFilters` and all ref. ID-based filters are being resolved to appropriate objects by the parent component itself right?\r\n\r\nSo before even you reach the AssetsFilter (Slideover) component, you already have a Record<key: FilterName, value: string | ResolvedObject> right? \r\n\r\nPassing this to the slide-over should simply work right?\r\n\r\nNow for the clearFilter, the behaviour is pretty simple and straightforward across all filters. It just needs to navigate to the URL without query params. Updating the state need not be done since the qParams automatically will be updated since URL has changed, hence relevant parts will be re-rendered and states get updated.\r\n\r\n(I'm not sure if I'm missing something you are trying to convey, correct me if I'm wrong)"

Could you help tailwind the async autocomplete field in the https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/pull/3744 patient filters?\r\n\r\nGenerally, apart from that, I was thinking of having all the input components have their own validators and also be compliant with form reducers across care since we mostly have only `set_form` and `set_error` only.\r\n\r\nso that, the component's API interface would just take in the additional props (validator, reducerProps) [see this](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/pull/3744/files#diff-2c391d69e3a85e37959e9843913cba1d1db5aa23dac46c81625b168a38c78d9cR18-R29).\r\n\r\nhowever, the components API should still be usable when not used with reducers.\r\nSo I was just taking time to document it clearly so that it's easily maintainable by everyone and changing the component API interface later would be a hassle.\r\n\r\nFor example, the text input is composed like this:\r\nhttps://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/pull/3744/files#diff-e0e39dd41cb8f0b76d60275fa706cd765c8648107e45183f24781aa0cd51145f\r\nand when used with reducers, the amount of code we write would be so less, but still, it'll render out the errors and field labels without having to write separate components each time."

      "text": "@gigincg I'm thinking of taking this up.\r\n\r\nTwo approaches can be there.\r\n\r\n### 1. Client Side\r\nWhere each preset is traversed and selected at an interval controlled by the client side.\r\nHowever in this method the middleware will not be aware whether a client is using patrol mode or not, and hence other clients who might access the same camera will also not be aware of this. Set preset requests may conflict the order if more than one client accesses it.\r\n\r\n### 2. Server side\r\nAn endpoint for the camera can be exposed to enable patrol mode, and also status response can include whether the resource is in patrol mode or not. Hence every client will be aware whether it's in patrol mode or not. Presets are traversed and selected by the middleware/backend, hence order is maintained regardless of multiple clients accessing the resource. Preset traverse interval can be optionally adjusted by client."
