      "text": "> But won't it still be the same? We are just changing UI. The device list will show all the camera(front and back) and user can select front camera as preferred camera while having facing mode as back.🤔 We can do one more thing, isn't it possible to filter camera on the basis of facing mode? I tried to find out this whether we can do it or not but not able to get any solid answer. @Jacobjeevan\r\n\r\nNo, current approach would make it seem like the dropdown value should correspond to preview. Changing the UI in this case provides a separation and makes it more clear that they are separate elements.\r\n\r\nLet's not filter by facing mode, just do as I mentioned - dropdown should list all possible cameras; when user opens up the preview modal to take a picture, it should be defaulting to the preferred camera (assuming user has picked one before and it's in cache)."

If users don’t want to customize the names, the form stays clean and uncluttered. I personally feel it’s a great way to keep things organized—users can expand it only if they need to customize, otherwise, they can move to the next input field.\r\n\r\nI see where you are going with that, but let's not do. It's redundant because of the checkbox."

As shown in the screenshots, the issue was due to space-x-6 on the tabs, which caused horizontal scrolling on smaller screens. After changing it to space-x-4, the issue was resolved. For other pages, like the Questionnaire page, the horizontal scroll is caused by the table overflowing, which breaks the layout. Given these findings, please reconsider checking the issue\n\nIt's coming from changes in AppRouter made recently (all of these pages mentioned were working fine until recently).\n\n Anyways, I'm pushing a PR addressing this 👍 "

Could you please confirm if this issue is occurring on your side as well?\r\n> \r\n> If it’s not an isolated issue and is happening globally, it might be related to how useState is being used inside the onSelect handler. I haven't been able to pinpoint the exact cause yet. It would be greatly appreciated if you could share any insights on how to fix this, as I plan to address it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI think the issue is due to to component lifecycle and how it handles hook recreation - when isPdf changed, hook is recreated, but the component is also re-rendered (I'm assuming there's some issue with event handling/file input going on at this stage).\r\n\r\nA cleaner approach would be to create a checkbox option within the existing dialog box and then pass it as a variable to fileupload.handleFileUpload, while maintaining the state only within FileUploadDialog component."

      "text": "> **Test Report**\r\n> \r\n> **Functionality Bug**\r\n* [x]  When you search for a username, the input field disappears. It only reappears after clearing the badge. Please revert this to the original behavior where the search field remains visible at all times.\r\n* [x]  Similar issue noticeable for advanced filter as well\r\n* [x]  Disable the \"Add Facility\" button for non-admin users on their own pages.\r\n* [x]  Allow non-admin users to unlink their home facility and any facility in their access.\r\n* [x]   The avatar on the user profile page and the profile icon are different. Please make them consistent.\r\n* [x]  Reset the component's state after the password has been successfully changed.\r\n\r\n> **Question For Clarity**\r\n>     * [ ]  Only the account owner should be able to edit their own user information. However, with your current PR, an admin can edit other users' profiles. Is this the intended behavior?\r\n\r\nYep, that's the intention. \r\n\r\n>     * [ ]  The new profile view details page and the personal profile page display nearly identical data. Could we consider combining them into a single page for simplicity and consistency? [Discuss with the core team].\r\n\r\nYep, we are merging those (removing current profile page), I was waiting on it since there was an intern PR open updating elements in Profile page. We can open an issue that interns can take up once this is merged\r\n\r\n* [x]  Ensure the first column remains fixed in the mobile view for the user list. This will improve accessibility and ease of navigation.\r\n\r\n>     * [ ]  Add a \"Last Modified\" column in the user view page to display the date and time when the profile was last updated. Additionally, consider implementing an alert system to notify users to reverify their profile details after a period of 6 months or 1 year. This will help ensure that user information remains up-to-date. [Discussion required with core team before proceeding]\r\n\r\n🤔  Yea could do for enhancement.\r\n\r\nHere are the tests passing locally:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"605\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3592e7fd-be89-48b9-b934-fb059f4eecda\">\r\n\r\nDetails on the error (screenshot below). I sometimes encounter this when testing after resetting the db; bypass it by manually logging in the cypress window.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a897b218-2cbd-48cd-b59a-f7a687029d19)\r\n"
