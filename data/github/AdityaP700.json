This could simplify the user experience. For example, if a user wants to scroll upward, they could simply click it to move in that direction. I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Upon investigating the issue in depth, I’ve identified some concerns while attempting to replicate it myself. \nFor Test-1:  \nWhen creating a new location, one must be an Admin to add a new location within a facility. However, when creating a Multi-type location, I’d like to clarify your statement about keeping the location within a single test. Did you mean something like this:\n\n- ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72a49fae-8f42-4f73-b898-7834dddbd8f8)\n\n- ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed1dab63-1fb5-4823-8361-dbc1fda94ba0)\n\n\nOr were you referring to something different? When assigning a new location to a patient during a live encounter, the search functionality works correctly under certain conditions, such as when the child location is set to Bed.\nWell looking forward for your response as with clarifications i will be able to complete the testing and make the PR soon.\nThanks\n\n"
