      "text": "It looks like it might have been introduced by the recent pull request: https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/pull/7305.\r\n\r\nThe `renderFileUpload` method [new includes](https://github.com/coronasafe/care_fe/blob/f39ce8344e7087cfe3288fcabc761cd671221df0/src/Components/Patient/FileUpload.tsx#L579-L580) the following:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n  <span className=\"font-semibold leading-relaxed\">\r\n    File Name:{\" \"}\r\n  </span>{\" \"}\r\n  {item.name}\r\n  {item.extension}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut previously it was:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n <div>\r\n  <span className=\"font-semibold leading-relaxed\">\r\n    File Name:{\" \"}\r\n  </span>{\" \"}\r\n  {item.name}\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nbut name as stored in `FileUpload.name` already has `.pdf` extension, added in:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/coronasafe/care/blob/8616f5c956f0ee8f252ea5f0581bb1fd2dff986f/care/facility/utils/reports/discharge_summary.py#L180-L185\r\n\r\nWould it be better to change it on back-end or frond-end? My thinking is that it may be better fixing it on front-end, as on back-end it was working okay, it communicates with S3 so I'm not sure what implication would be for changing file name pattern. Front-end uses files taken from S3 and the code adding second \".pdf\" extension is a new addition so changing it should not cause much issues for the whole system.\r\n\r\nI saw that there were no tests for this part of code. Would you accept a pull request adding a test? I may have time over the weekend to add it."
