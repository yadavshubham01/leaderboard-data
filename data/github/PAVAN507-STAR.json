      "text": "> Hey @PAVAN507-STAR\r\n> \r\n> Although your PR does achieve the functionallity almost right without using Jotai, using Jotai (as hinted in issue) was a much more cleaner approach as you wouldn't have to manually write useEffects to handle initial state and call localStorage methods to read or write to it. With `useAtom` you could simply use it like a `useState` and the state be synced with local storage by Jotai.\r\n\r\nOkay cool,will improve in further contributions.I asked for assign in couple of issues .can u check and tell if it's possible for u to assign me those issues?"
