Do make sure changes its copied exactly as is to avoid merge conflicts.\r\n\r\nThank you for the suggestion. You're absolutely right that KanbanBoardType<T> is redundant since it's exactly the same as KanbanBoardProps<T>. I'll remove KanbanBoardType<T> and directly reuse KanbanBoardProps<T> to keep the code clean and consistent."
