Since we are allowing users to move the nodes around, expand/collapse should preserve their current position, no? Instead it resets it 🤔\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Well, not a big deal per say, depends on what we want product side.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Yeah, the root doesn’t allow expansion/collapse, so I’ll hide the chevron.\r\n2. Good point it depends on what we want from the product side. If needed, we could add a button to reset the node, though it’s not mandatory.\r\n\r\nI guess for now, I’ll quickly hide the chevron for the root.\r\n\r\n"
