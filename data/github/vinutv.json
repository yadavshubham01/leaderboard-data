For Admins, this tab can be accessed via the Users list. For doctors, could we add a direct 'Schedule' link in the sidebar that redirects them to the Availability tab in their user profile? Otherwise, if a doctor needs to set their own schedule, they’d have to navigate through their profile to find the Availability tab, which may be tedious.\r\n\r\n[Figma link](https://www.figma.com/design/Z93EYKSa1MdBmXndsMBJSQ/Care?node-id=1081-1690)"

All other links should be organised as tabs. There should be a single **primary call-to-action** on to patient card based on the user’s role. For example, for doctors, the CTA should be \"Start Consultation\", and for front desk staff, it should be \"Book Appointment\".\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @bodhish ?"
