A dashboard like UI (such as consultation dashboard), may have multiple pagination components present in a single view. And these page states would be managed internally and not on the search params.\r\n\r\nI definitely know that this is not the best approach one can have. But the pagination in the discharged section is not handled neatly.\r\nPagination in Live Patients is handled through \"Pagination\" from \"filters\" which uses \"PaginationComponent\" whereas in Discharged Patients , it is handled through \"PaginatedList\" which uses \"Paginator\" which uses \"Pagination\" different from the former mentioned.\r\n\r\nTherefore, i saw that this works fine.

      "text": "@rithviknishad this has been solved by probably two ways. Since Combobox.input does not explicitly support this type of styling , 2 ways seemed to me to get it solved. The easiest way to get this solved was to use any pre-worked feature / library (increasing dependencies), while the other way round was to create from scratch, by working on the stylings , modifying some, and then achieving the required. Do let me know which one to push. I prefer the latter one since combobox consistency will be preserved along with no increase in dependency."
