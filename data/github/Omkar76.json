The button has text \"Copy values from previous log\". If we use this to toggle, we need to change the button text also. What should the text be when button is used to toggle `clone_last` to false? \r\n\r\nPS: Still thinking checkbox is correct control here. In case we still want to move forward with button - let me know what button text should be in both states. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"

      "text": "Hi @bodhish,\r\nWorking on your suggestion to use css text-transform instead of `startCase` and `camelCase`. From what I'm seeing I think it won't be able to replace those methods . Correct me if wrong\r\n\r\n> Is a keyword that converts the first letter of each word to uppercase. Other characters remain unchanged (they retain their original case as written in the element's text).\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform\r\n\r\n`sampleDetails.status` can have value \"COMPLETED\". We need \"Completed\".  `capitalize` class won't do that. Similar issue for `sampleDetails.doctor_name` and maybe in other places.\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/wR1YZEkNsO\r\n\r\n"

      "text": "> @Omkar76 wasn't the issue about removing and using custom utility functions instead?\r\n> \r\n> This PR is just replacing with another package and updating the imports and doesn't make a noticeable difference in the final bundle size.\r\n> \r\n> We could achieve a much lower bundle size if we built the utility functions within care right?\r\n> \r\n> cc: @sainak\r\n\r\nI believe the size reduction is significant (547 -> 122). We can keep this PR on hold until @sainak has implemented the utilities to replace lodash. If that reduces size significantly more than this we can merge that instead. "
